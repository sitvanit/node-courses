/* Understanding setImmediate() */

When you want to execute some piece of code asynchronously, but as soon as possible, one option is to use the
setImmediate() function provided by Node.js:

setImmediate(() => {
  //run something
})

Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that’s executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

A function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the
current operation ends. This means it will always execute before setTimeout() and setImmediate().

A setTimeout() callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to setImmediate(). The execution order will depend on various
factors, but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.
